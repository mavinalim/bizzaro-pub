# Bizzaro User Guide 

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (x64).
- Internet access.

---

## Install

  - Place it in a folder you can write to (for settings).
  - Double-click to run.

---

## Activation
1. Start the app. If not activated, you’ll see the activation window.
2. Click Copy to copy your HWID.
3. Send HWID to admin and wait for activation.
4. Click "Check Activation" to proceed or reload the application.

---

## Quick Start

2. Load or configure your skills/actions in the UI.
3. Use the hotkeys to start/stop.
4. Keep the game window focused to receive key inputs.

---

## Hotkeys & Controls
- Start: `F9`
- Stop: `F10`
- Only one skill action runs at any time (serialized execution).
- Spam option: If enabled, it forces cooldown 0 for rapid keying. Use carefully.

---

## UI Concepts
- Skills Panel: Add/enable actions to perform. Each action can have its own key/cooldown.
- Spam Toggle: Enables rapid repeated actions; best combined with conservative tolerance settings.
- Tolerance: Pixel or detection tolerance for vision-based features; tweak if detections are unstable.
- Preview: Small preview may be shown while vision checks run; keep it closed for best performance if not needed.

---

## AI Nudge & Minimap Tracker
- AI Nudge: When enabled, the assistant can suggest or auto-trigger context-aware actions based on minimap or screen cues.
- Minimap Tracker: Tracks simple features on the minimap to drive nudges (e.g., approach, evade, or rotate actions).
- Tips:
  - Ensure the game UI scale and resolution remain consistent.
  - Keep the minimap in a predictable screen region.
  - Adjust tolerance if detections flicker.

---

## Telegram Integration (Optional)
- If configured, Bizzaro can send simple status or event messages to a Telegram chat.
- You will need a bot token and chat ID (provided by the admin or created by you).
- Toggle on/off from the app UI if available; keep credentials private.

---

## Troubleshooting
- Not Activated:
  - Ensure network connectivity.
  - Confirm with admin that your HWID is activated and not expired.
  - Click "Check Activation" again or restart the app.
- Keys Not Working:
  - Make sure to run as ADMIN
  - Ensure the game window is focused (topmost and active).
  - Check skills panel settings and cooldowns.
- Detection Unstable:
  - Adjust tolerance.
  - Keep consistent resolution and UI scale.
- App Closes During Session:
  - Your license may have expired or been revoked; contact admin to renew.

---

## Privacy
- The app does not collect personal data beyond activation checks.

---

## Tips for Best Results
- Keep the game window focused while running Bizzaro.
